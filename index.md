# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the  
**Laboratoire Ondes et MatiÃ¨re d'Aquitaine (LOMA), University of Bordeaux**,  
working with **Thomas Salez**.  

My research lies at the intersection of **soft matter physics**, **fluid dynamics**, and **statistical mechanics**, with a particular focus on:

- ðŸ§© **Active matter near interfaces**  
- ðŸŒŠ **Elasto-electro-hydrodynamics**  
- âš¡ **Electrokinetic effects in confined flows**  
- ðŸ”¬ **Transport and dispersion phenomena in micro- and nano-fluidic systems**

## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests
I am interested in how microscopic dynamics and interactions shape the emergent behavior of complex systems.  
My current projects explore:
- Hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions of **active particles, droplets, and GUVs near fluidâ€“fluid interfaces**  
- The coupling of **adsorptionâ€“desorption kinetics** with **electrokinetics and dispersion** in confined geometries  
- Statistical mechanics approaches to transport in **branched networks and complex flows**
